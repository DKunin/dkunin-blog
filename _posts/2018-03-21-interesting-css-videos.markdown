I never understood the problem frontend devs have with CSS, always retweeting the "Family Guy Blinds = CSS" gif, as far as I am concerned - I never had a problem that couldn't been handled in a nice way, and the possibilities for creativity are just enormous.

In my book CSS => Awesome, if you think it sucks - maybe you're doing it wrong.
