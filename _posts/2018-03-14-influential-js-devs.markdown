Nice post by John Hannah, The only thing I would change about the list - is put Andr√© first, cause his motivations to make web more open and give the power back to the people instead of the corporations inspire me, personally, the most. My favorite post of his: [A plan to rescue the web from the internet](https://staltz.com/a-plan-to-rescue-the-web-from-the-internet.html)
